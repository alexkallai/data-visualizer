Features to do:
2D and 3D digraphs
    display only selected section
    there should be bit and byte offset (or just only multi-byte offset?)
    there should be configurable display line lengths
bi-directional hex and graphical navigation
hilbert translation
    maps 1D space to an alternative dimensional space
    preserves locality
    hilbert byte plot
    shaded by byte class
coloring by entropy

previews are byteplots
Automatic binary mapping through byte plot is
suggested by Conti et al. [14]. Byte plot visualization is
used to identify the internal structure of the binary files.
Each byte in the target binary file is transformed into a
pixel value, ranging from 0 to FF. 0 value represents
white and FF value represents black

classification:
    naiive bayes classification of n-gram models
